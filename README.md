# Agrobot - Teachable Machine Web Classifier

This is a simple website that uses a Teachable Machine model to classify images from your webcam in real time.

## How it works

1. The model is loaded directly from Teachable Machine using TensorFlow.js.
2. When you click the **Start** button, the webcam starts.
3. The model begins making predictions and shows the results (with accuracy percentages) live on the screen.

## About the model

The AI model was trained using Google's Teachable Machine. It is designed to recognize objects or humans forms related to the **Agrobot** prototype.

## Files included

- `index.html`: Main file. It contains everything needed for the model to run on the web.

## Note

To use the webcam, the website will ask for permission. Be sure to **allow access** when prompted.

## Project info

This website is part of the **Agrobot project**, created for the **BIEA STEM Youth Innovation Competition**.
